Project 1: Todo_Firebase

This Flutter Todo App project demonstrates how to build a simple yet powerful cross-platform mobile application using Flutter
and Firebase. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks to manage their to-do lists effectively. With real-time
synchronization provided by Firebase Cloud Firestore, users can seamlessly access their tasks from multiple devices. The apps
user authentication using Firebase Authentication is pending* to ensure secure access to personal task lists.


Project 2: Todo_Hive_MVVM_Provider

Introducing Todo_Hive_MVVM: A smart Flutter Todo App that uses Hive, a speedy local database. With the easy-to-follow MVVM setup and handy Provider tool, it's a breeze to manage tasks across devices. Your tasks stay put even offline, thanks to Hive, and the organized MVVM approach keeps things tidy. Plus, adding secure login down the road is a snap. This project is all about smooth task-handling using Hive's speed, MVVM's orderliness, and Provider's quick updates.
